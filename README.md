                                              Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Prodigy InfoTech Internship Task 03)

                                              
##Project Description

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It allows two players to compete against each other by taking turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to achieve three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent.

##Installation Instructions

As a web application, there's no installation required for users. The Tic-Tac-Toe game will be accessible through a web browser.

##Usage Examples

Start the game: The application will likely have a button or interface element to initiate a new game.
Take turns: Players will take turns clicking on empty squares on the grid to place their marks.
Win or Draw: The game will determine the winner (the first player to achieve three marks in a row) or declare a draw if the board fills without a winner.
Restart: The application might offer a button to restart the game and begin a new match.
